# Photo App
After cloning down the project navigate to the root of the project and run npm install.
Run npm start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Test 
Run npm test to run unit tests. A web browser should pop up to show the status of the tests. 

#Notes
I wanted to showcase the front end skills that I developed while at Granular. For this reason I chose to build a web application. 
With that being said I am not a great designer so please forgive the poor design. When clicking on an album a child list should expand so that you can
see all of the images in the album. Clicking anywhere within that list again will collapse the list of images. PhotoId's can be viewed on the right
hand of the page when Photo's are visible. 

I view this project as more of a prototype. Future additions to this project could include periodically updating the list of images in the background.
In the projects current state if the backing service were to add new images, the client would need to refresh the page in order to see said images.
